# RAW Labs VS Code Extension

## Introduction
RAW is a software platform to enable fast and easy data delivery and sharing via APIs. RAW allows a Data Producer to:

- Query multiple data sources including: files, databases and APIs
- Integrate and transform
- Deliver and manage the data product output as APIs
- Share access to the APIs with any number of Data Consumers

RAW runs in the Cloud using a scalable infrastructure that is fully managed, so that you can just concentrate on delivering business functionality. RAW is built using DataOps principles that facilitate greater quality and decreased delivery time and faster iterations.

Create a query using RAW SQL, Configure an API endpoint using the query in a YAML file. Push both to your GitHub repository, and your API is ready via our DataOps infrastructure.
